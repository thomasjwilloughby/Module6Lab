### Exercise 1

This is an observation study. Given the study design we cannot answer the question posed, as in an observational study one cannot determine causation only correlation.

### Exercise 2

The distribution is left skewed. This indicates that there are few students giving the professors low rating. This is roughly what I would expect to see as there will always be some ratting at the lower end.

ggplot(data = evals, aes(x = score)) +
  geom_histogram()
